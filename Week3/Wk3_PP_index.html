            <p id="body-life">In this life, nothing matters more to a bodybuilder than being the best. This comes with lots of food sacrifices, which is limiting the amount of consumption of fast-foods, alcohol, sugars, etc. Most times are spent in the gym and less on hobbies that take away their growth. However to the individual seeking to become a bodybuilder, this is but an obstacle they seek to overcome. And although the tasks of staying in the gym and eating the right foods is difficult, they are willing to make sacrifices to be the best.</p>
