                <h1>SEASON 10: EMERGENCE</h1>

                <h3>AMBUSH ARTIST</h3>
                <p>Before his birth, it was foretold that Seer would bring pain and suffering to the world--and the night he was born, a meteor barreled across the sky and struck his worldâ€™s moon. It was considered a bad omen, and when the pale blue eyes of Obi Edolasim opened, his community saw a cursed child. His parents did not; they loved him unconditionally because they saw the true empathic, creative soul of their son. They even supported him when he was drawn to the theatricality of the Arenas, where he could express himself fully.</p>
                <p>This season offers a new set of skins for weapons and characters. Along with new emotes for those who enjoy boasting after being named champions or LEGENDS, as they say. So jump in the decimated World's Edge with our new weapon addition, the RAMPAGE and win the LEGEND title. Happy hunting LEGENDS.</p>
